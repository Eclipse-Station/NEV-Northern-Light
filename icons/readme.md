# STOP AND READ CAREFULLY!

Do not make changes to the files in this, as there is no easy way to solve merge conflicts with icon files, and files are likely to be overwritten if we pull sprites from upstream. Instead, please do one of the following:

1. Make a new folder in `zzz_modular_eclipse/` and put your sprites in there.
2. Make a new file with a `_eclipse.dmi` suffix and put your custom sprites in there.

After you put your custom sprites in, change the `icon` var to point to the new sprites' locations.
