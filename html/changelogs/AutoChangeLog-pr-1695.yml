changes:
  - refactor: Refactor of Vermin spawn code.
  - bugfix: Vermin will no longer attempt to spawn more Vermin above open spaces.
  - bugfix: Vermin should no longer be biased north/south when they spawn a new Vermin.
      Any bias left is the result of inherent bias within the pick() proc.
  - bugfix: Vermin now have a cap of 80 "power nutrition", meaning if a player hacks
      their way to one that is waiting to spawn another Vermin, then only one Vermin
      will be spawned by it (up to 3 due to neighbouring Vermin).
  - server: This PR does NOT revert the "excess mob count" warning, so admins (and
      players, if no admin is on) will still be notified if things Go Sideways.
