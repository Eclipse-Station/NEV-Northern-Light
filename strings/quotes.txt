"When you want to know how things really work, study them when they're coming apart." - William Gibson, Zero History
"Cyberspace. A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts... A graphic representation of data abstracted from banks of every computer in the human system. Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind, clusters and constellations of data. Like city lights, receding..." - William Gibson, Neuromancer

"We have sealed ourselves away behind our money, growing inward, generating a seamless universe of self." - William Gibson, Neuromancer
"Night City was like a deranged experiment in social Darwinism, designed by a bored researcher who kept one thumb permanently on the fast-forward button." - William Gibson, Neuromancer
"That's something that tends to happen with new technologies generally: The most interesting applications turn up on a battlefield, or in a gallery." - William Gibson, Spook Country

"A middleman’s business is to make himself a necessary evil." - William Gibson, Neuromancer

"Paranoia, he said, was fundamentally egocentric, and every conspiracy theory served in some way to aggrandize the believer." - William Gibson, Pattern Recognition

"Right," Holden said. "No coffee. This is a terrible, terrible planet." - James S.A. Corey, Cibola Burn

"Good, because I don’t use sex as a weapon," Bobbie said. "I use weapons as weapons." - James S.A. Corey, Caliban's War
"It killed humans, therefore it was a weapon. But radiation killed humans, and a medical X-ray machine wasn’t intended as a weapon. Holden was starting to feel like they were all monkeys playing with a microwave. Push a button, a light comes on inside, so it’s a light. Push a different button and stick your hand inside, it burns you, so it’s a weapon. Learn to open and close the door, it’s a place to hide things. Never grasping what it actually did, and maybe not even having the framework necessary to figure it out. No monkey ever reheated a frozen burrito." - James S.A. Corey, Abaddon's Gate

"Last man standing," Amos replied with another grin. "It's in my job description." - James S.A. Corey, Cibola Burn
"Posthuman. It was a word that came up in the media every five or six years, and it meant different things every time. Neural regrowth hormone? Posthuman. Sex robots with inbuilt pseudo intelligence? Posthuman. Self-optimizing network routing? Posthuman. It was a word from advertising copy, breathless and empty, and all he’d ever thought it really meant was that the people using it had a limited imagination about what exactly humans were capable of." - James S.A. Corey, Leviathan Wakes
"No rest for the wicked, no peace for the good." - James S.A. Corey, Abaddon's Gate

"Everyone too busy trying to survive to spend any time creating something new." - James S.A. Corey, Leviathan Wakes
"Well, mostly I’m a mechanic. But the idea that the UN has a file on me somewhere that lists me as the Rocinante’s killer? That’s kind of awesome." - James S.A. Corey, Nemesis Games
"GOODY. MY SPLEEN IS COLLAPSING. HURRY UP." - James S.A. Corey, Leviathan Wakes

"It’s a simple complex system. That’s the technical name for it. Because it’s simple, it’s prone to cascades, and because it’s complex, you can’t predict what’s going to fail. Or how. It’s computationally impossible." - James S.A. Corey, Caliban's War
"Alien superweapons were used," Alex said, walking into the room, sleep-sweaty hair standing out from his skull in every direction. "The laws of physics were altered, mistakes were made." - James S.A. Corey, Nemesis Games
"Once is never. Twice is always." - James S.A. Corey, Cibola Burn
"Say what you will about organized crime, at least it’s organized." - James S.A. Corey, Leviathan Wakes
"I have killed, but I am not a killer because a killer is a monster, and monsters aren’t afraid." - James S.A. Corey, Babylon's Ashes
"Anyone can kill a planet from orbit," Holden replied. "You don’t even need bombs. Just push anvils out the airlock. That thing out there could kill… Shit. Anything." - James S.A. Corey, Leviathan Wakes
"Just do not pull that fucking trigger. Do you understand what I'm saying? Don't. You will be personally responsible for the deadliest screwup in the history of humankind, and I'm on a ship with Jim fucking Holden, so the bar's not low." - James S.A. Corey, Caliban's War
"Reputation never has very much to do with reality. I could name half a dozen paragons of virtue that are horrible, small-souled, evil people. And some of the best men I know, you'd walk out of the room if you heard their names. No one on the screen is who they are when you breathe their air." - James S.A. Corey, Caliban's War

"It occurs to me that our survival may depend upon our talking to one another." - Dan Simmons, Hyperion

"Evolution brings human beings. Human beings, through a long and painful process, bring humanity." - Dan Simmons, Hyperion
"In twentieth-century Old Earth, a fast food chain took dead cow meat, fried it in grease, added carcinogens, wrapped it in petroleum-based foam, and sold nine hundred billion units. Human beings. Go figure." - Dan Simmons, Hyperion

"But if they did, they would know that hell was with them, that there was a Heaven that men called Heaven, and in it there was a center from which all madness flowed; and once within that center, there was peace." - Harlan Ellison, The Beast That Shouted Love At The Heart Of The World

"The pasokon rang again. A shining white cat appeared on the screen. It had large, staring, unearthly eyes. "Let him go," the cat commanded in English." - Bruce Sterling, Maneki Neko
"Louise lifted the maneki neko, handling it as if it were a live eel. "These little Japanese voodoo cats. Maneki neko, right? They started showing up everywhere I went. There's a china cat in my handbag. There's three china cats at the office. Suddenly they're on display in the windows of every antique store in Providence. My car radio starts making meowing noises at me." - Bruce Sterling, Maneki Neko
"Life, and intelligence, do not mix very well." - Bruce Sterling, Schismatrix
"The Zaibatsu recognizes one civil right: the right to death." - Bruce Sterling, Schismatrix

"Twenty meters down, it's difficult to tell what is and isn't supposed to be there. Your flashlights stop working. At least, I think they do. There's light coming out of them, but they don't show anything. They only show what you want to see. Not what's actually there..." - Unmarked Expedition Papers, Unknown Author
"No, look here. The pipes are old," James observed. "But the rest of it's all new." I could see what he meant. The scrubber pipes were bent, rusted-over, and looked like they had melted into the brand-new plating.

"...suggest that the ship's mechanisms somehow manipulate time and space somewhere inside it, lengthening its lifespan and creating a fluctuation of bluespace-trace readings that..."
"The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed (and hence clamorous to be led to safety) by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins, all of them imaginary." - H.L Mencken
"Reports earlier today from the Virgo system say an large vessel crashed near an orbital tether. Authorities are still investigating who the ship belonged to, as there appear to be no survivors or any hint of habitatants, period, aboard the vessel. The local customs office requests that anyone who may own, or may know the owner of, a 'Northern Light', to step forwards." - Virgo Today, Hourly News
