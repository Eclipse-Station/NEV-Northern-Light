# Custom items go here. They are modifications of existing paths; look at the example for details.
# Item will spawn if the target has one of the req_titles and if their on-spawn ID has the required access level.
# req_access is going to be a shit to maintain since the config file can't grab constants and has to use integers, use it minimally.
# Separate titles with a single comma and a space (', ') or they'll bork.

# EX:

# item_icon: flagmask     
# item_desc: It's truly hideous.
# req_titles: Assistant, Security Officer

If you’re on a budget, it’s a darn good rifle for just about everything.
This is a somewhat-modified (and visibly used) rifle, using a lever-operated action. There's an inscription on the side: "Wish you were here"

item_name: worn squadron leader beret
item_desc: What might seem like a just another worn-out piece of headwear, reveals to be much more upon closer inspection. This beret seems to be connected to an unidentified fighter wing, the emblem on the front of the beret's been worn down to the point that it's only distinct feature are three small chevrons flying in formation with each other. Though age has taken it's toll, the beret seems to be lovingly cared for, as there are small signs of repair upon the fabric.
