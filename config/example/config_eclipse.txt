## Comment to disable.
#USE_JOB_WHITELISTING

## INCLUDE ADMINS

## This will not stop them from spawning in a character using the admin tools,
## only the game preferences.
## Uncomment to require them to be whitelisted.

# ROUNDSTART REQUIREMENTS
#########

## REQUIRE A HEAD OF STAFF
## Should a head of staff be required for the round to start? By default, a head
## of staff is required to start the round.
## Uncomment to bypass this requirement.
#BYPASS_HEAD_OF_STAFF_REQUIREMENT

## HEAD OF STAFF AND ENGINEER LOWPOP THRESHOLD
## When should we stop bypassing the requirements for an engineer and a head of
## staff? This is done automatically to allow rounds with low population to be
## played normally.
## Default: 10
STAFF_REQUIREMENT_LOWPOP_THRESHOLD 10

# DISPATCHER
#########

## MASTER ENABLE
## Should the dispatcher be enabled? If disabled, only the player tracking system
## will be functional.
## Uncomment to enable.

## DEBUG LEVEL
## What level should we debug the dispatcher on?
## Note that admins will still be notified for severe and fatal messages.
## 0 - Fatal and runtimes only
## 1 - Severe
## 2 - Warnings
## 3 - Verbose
# Default is 1.
DEBUG_DISPATCHER 1

## DISPATCHER COOLDOWN
## After a message is sent, how long should the global cooldown be before another
## can be sent to the dispatcher? 
## Default is 180 seconds (3 minutes)
## Units: Seconds
DISPATCHER_COOLDOWN 180

## DISPATCHER RATE LIMITER
## This is the number of maximum concurrent operations allowed. After this limit
## is reached, the dispatcher will wait a tick before continuing. This is to
## prevent a server stall condition while lists populate.
## Default: 10
MAXIMUM_CONCURRENT_OPERATIONS 10

## DISPATCHER ROLE IDENTIFIERS

## DISPATCHER MAXIMA FOR PINGS
## Maximum number of players the dispatcher will allow before it won't pass on
## a message to the discord. Set to -1 to disable playercount checks. (This is
## not recommended and will throw a warning if disabled.)

# MISCELLANEOUS
#########

## GHOST ICON GENERATION
## Should we generate ghost icons based on the player's character, if they have
## no body (e.g. joined as observer)? This may cause a minor performance impact.
## Uncomment to enable.
#GENERATE_GHOST_ICONS
