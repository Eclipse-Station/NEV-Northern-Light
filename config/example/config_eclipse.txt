# WHITELISTING
#########

## MASTER ENABLE
## Uses the jobwhitelist.txt file to whitelist specific jobs.
## Comment to disable.
#USE_JOB_WHITELISTING

## INCLUDE ADMINS
## Should admins be required to be whitelisted as a job in order to play it? 
## This will not stop them from spawning in a character using the admin tools,
## only the game preferences.
## Uncomment to require them to be whitelisted.
#ADMINS_RESTRICTED_BY_WHITELIST

## WHITELIST HEADS OF STAFF
## Should heads of staff be whitelisted?
## Uncomment to whitelist.
#WHITELIST_HEADS

## WHITELIST SECURITY DEPARTMENT
## Should the Security department be whitelisted?
## Uncomment to whitelist.
#WHITELIST_SECURITY

## WHITELIST AI/CYBORG
## Should silicons be whitelisted? This will not affect pAIs, only AI and borgs.
## Uncomment to whitelist.
#WHITELIST_SILICONS

#########
# ROUNDSTART REQUIREMENTS
#########

## REQUIRE A HEAD OF STAFF
## Should a head of staff be required for the round to start? By default, a head
## of staff is required to start the round.
## Uncomment to bypass this requirement.
BYPASS_HEAD_OF_STAFF_REQUIREMENT

## HEAD OF STAFF AND ENGINEER LOWPOP THRESHOLD
## When should we stop bypassing the requirements for an engineer and a head of
## staff? This is done automatically to allow rounds with low population to be
## played normally.
## Default: 10
STAFF_REQUIREMENT_LOWPOP_THRESHOLD 10

#########
# DISPATCHER
#########

## MASTER ENABLE
## Should the dispatcher be enabled? If disabled, only the player tracking system
## will be functional.
## Uncomment to enable.
ENABLE_DISPATCHER

## DEBUG LEVEL
## What level should we debug the dispatcher on?
## Note that admins will still be notified for severe and fatal messages.
## 0 - Fatal and runtimes only
## 1 - Severe
## 2 - Warnings
## 3 - Verbose
# Default is 1.
DEBUG_DISPATCHER 3

## DISPATCHER COOLDOWN
## After a message is sent, how long should the global cooldown be before another
## can be sent to the dispatcher? 
## Default is 180 seconds (3 minutes)
## Units: Seconds
DISPATCHER_COOLDOWN 180

## DISPATCHER RATE LIMITER
## This is the number of maximum concurrent operations allowed. After this limit
## is reached, the dispatcher will wait a tick before continuing. This is to
## prevent a server stall condition while lists populate.
## Default: 10
MAXIMUM_CONCURRENT_OPERATIONS 10

## DISPATCHER ROLE IDENTIFIERS
## This is the role IDs used for role-specific pings from the dispatcher system.
## Parses as a string.
ROLE_PING_CHURCH dev_server_church_ping
ROLE_PING_COMMAND dev_server_command_ping
ROLE_PING_ENGINEERING dev_server_engi_ping
ROLE_PING_MEDICAL dev_server_medic_ping
ROLE_PING_RESEARCH dev_server_research_ping
ROLE_PING_SECURITY dev_server_sec_ping
ROLE_PING_SERVICE dev_server_service_ping
ROLE_PING_SUPPLY dev_server_supply_ping
ROLE_PING_RESTARTS dev_server_restarts_ping

## DISPATCHER MAXIMA FOR PINGS
## Maximum number of players the dispatcher will allow before it won't pass on
## a message to the discord. Set to -1 to disable playercount checks. (This is
## not recommended and will throw a warning if disabled.)
## Default: 1 (both)
DISPATCHER_MAXIMUM_NONCOMMAND_PING 1
DISPATCHER_MAXIMUM_COMMAND_PING 1
DISPATCHER_MAXIMUM_HIVEMIND_PING 15

## DISPATCHER MINIMUM FOR RESTART PING
## Minimum number of players that must be on before the dispatcher will ping for
## a server restart. This is a simple comparison, so setting to 0 will ping
## regardless of player count, and setting to 1 will ping if there's someone on.
## Default: 3
DISPATCHER_MINIMUM_ROUND_END_PING 1


## DISPATCHER PING ON ROUND END
## Should the dispatcher ping the "restarts" role when the round ends? The ping
## will occur just after the lists of antags and silicons are printed out, and
## pings regardless of the maxima above.
## Uncomment to enable.
DISPATCHER_PINGS_ON_ROUND_END

## SECURITY PING ON HIVEMIND ANNOUNCEMENT
## Should the dispatcher ping the "security" role when a Hivemind event is
## announced? This will send a ping regardless of player count.
## Uncomment to enable.
## WARNING: This option is mutually exclusive with the option immediately below.
DISPATCHER_MESSAGES_SECURITY_ON_HIVEMIND

## ALL-HANDS PING ON HIVEMIND ANNOUNCEMENT
## Should the dispatcher ping all roles, except the restart role, when a
## Hivemind event is announced?
## Uncomment to enable.
## WARNING: This option is mutually exclusive with the option immediately above.
DISPATCHER_MESSAGES_ALL_ON_HIVEMIND

## GHOST ICON GENERATION
## Should we generate ghost icons based on the player's character, if they have
## no body (e.g. joined as observer)? This may have a minor performance impact.
## Uncomment to enable.
GENERATE_GHOST_ICONS

## MAXIMUM SANITY REGENERATION FROM HUGS
## How low should sanity be before someone hugging someone else will give them
## any benefit? Note that sanity caps at 100, and goes down to 0 (with certain
## exceptions based on a player's selected background/perks).
## Default: 15
MAXIMUM_SANITY_REGEN_FROM_HUGS 15

## MAXIMUM SANITY REGENERATION FROM PLUSH TOYS
## How low should sanity be before someone hugging a plushie will give them any
## benefit? 
## WARNING: Plushies have no hug cooldown, so this should be set fairly low to
## reduce a player's ability to powergame by carrying a plush toy.
## Default: 5
MAXIMUM_SANITY_REGEN_FROM_PLUSHIES 5

## NUMBER OF EXOPLANETS TO GENERATE
## How many exoplanets should we generate for the overmap? Note that increasing
## this value will increase roundstart time, and may have a minor to moderate 
## impact on performance.
## Default: 2
EXOPLANETS_TO_GENERATE -1

## SHIP NAME
## What is the name of the ship?
## Parses as a string.
SHIP_NAME DEVSERVER
