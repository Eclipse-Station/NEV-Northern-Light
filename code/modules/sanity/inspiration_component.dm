/**
  * Simple data container component containing level up statistics.
  * This does NOT make something a valid inspiration. It simply holds the data in case it gets used as one!
  * To actually use it, the typepath of the object has to be contained within the sanity datum valid_inspiration list.
  * Assign this component to an item specifying which statistics should be levelled up, and the item will be able to be used as an inspiration.
  * The format of statistics is list(STAT_DEFINE = number) or a proc that returns such a list.
  * (This would've been better as an element instead of a component, but currently elements don't exist on cev eris. F)
