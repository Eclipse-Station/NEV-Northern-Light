/*
	Defines a firing mode for a gun.

	A firemode is created from a list of fire mode settings. Each setting modifies the value of the gun var with the same name.
	If the fire mode value for a setting is null, it will be replaced with the initial value of that gun's variable when the firemode is created.
	Obviously not compatible with variables that take a null value. If a setting is not present, then the corresponding var will not be modified.
