/*
IMPORTANT

There are important things regarding this file:

 * Rubbers are non sharp, embed capable objects, with non existing armor penetration. Their agony damage is generally lower then actuall one
 * The caliber ammont was lowered for a reason, don't add more bloat. If you need different values, use gun vars.
 * HV exist as antag option for better ammo.
 * Step delays - default value is 1. Lower value makes bullet go faster, higher value makes bullet go slower.
