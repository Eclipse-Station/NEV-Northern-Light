#define WELCOME_SERBS "You are a serbian mercenary, part of a team of professional soldiers. You are currently aboard your base preparing for a mission targeting the CEV Eris.<br>\
	<br>\
	In your base you will find your armoury full of weapon crates and the EVA capable SCAF armour. It is advised that you take a pistol, a rifle, a knife and a SCAF suit for basic equipment.<br>\
	Once you have your basic gear, you may also wish to take along a specialist weapon, like the RPG-7 or the Pulemyot Kalashnikova. Each of the specialist weapons is powerful but very bulky, you will need to wear it over your back.<br>\
	<br>\
	Discuss your specialties with your team, choose a broad range of weapons that will allow your group to overcome a variety of obstacles. Search the base and load up everything onto your ship which may be useful, you will not be able to easily return here once you depart.<br>\
	When ready, use the console on your shuttle bridge to depart for Eris. Travelling will take several minutes, and you will be detected before you even arrive, stealth is not an option. Once you arrive, you have a time limit to complete your mission."
