The assigned supervisor of the vast rusting hulk that is the NEV Northern Light. At least, as long as you keep sending the expedition reports.<br>\
This ship is a pinnacle of your career, crewed by an alliance of corporations and factions that NanoTrasen has brokered uneasy treaties with.<br>\

You are the supreme leader of this world, and your word is law. But only as long as you can enforce that law.<br>\
The heads of the factions which make up your command staff, each have their own agendas. Their interests must be served too. If you make them unhappy, the loyalty of their faction goes with them, and you may have a mutiny on your hands.<br>\
Treat your command officers with respect, and listen to their council. Try not to micromanage their departments or interfere in their affairs, and they should serve you well<br>\

You are a free agent, able to go where you will, and loyal only to NanoTrasen. This ship however, left the Corporation with quite a bit of unpaid bills. So wherever you go, you should be sure a profitable venture awaits."

	Your second loyalty is to the Northern Light, your ship. It is the pinnacle of your career, and you are nothing without it. If it were to be destroyed, you and your descendants would be ruined for centuries. <br>\

Your third loyalty is to your command officers. The heads of each faction. Listen to their counsel, ensure their interests are served, and keep them happy"

A retired general or naval officer?<br>\
Perhaps you're the captain's sibling, firstborn, or spouse. Nobody can prevent nepotism if they choose<br>\
