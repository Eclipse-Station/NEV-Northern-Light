/*
 * Alright, coders, listen and listen well.
 *
 * I am flirting with disaster below by using selected_alarm:proc instead of
 * selected_alarm.proc (note the separators). Doing this tells the compiler, "I
 * know what I'm doing, leave me alone with that 'proc not found' bollocks".
 *
 * While I have included checks to ensure that the right type of machinery is
 * capable of using the proc, if you have to use a colon instead of a fullstop
 * to denote the proc of an atom, then I would very strongly encourage that you
 * re-evaluate the way it's coded in and ask yourself, "is it absolutely 100%
 * necessary to use this?"
 *
 * Odds are very likely that A.) there is a much better way to code it without 
 * needing the : separator, B.) you're flirting with disaster, and C.) that I am
 * absolutely going to nitpick the fact that you used the : separator instead of
 * the . separator.
